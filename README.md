# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
MNIST Digit Recognition.

Implemented using simple multi-layer Perceptron and also implemented using CNN.

CNN Implementation layers:

1.Convolutional layer with 30 feature maps of size 5×5.
2.Pooling layer taking the max over 2*2 patches.
3.Convolutional layer with 15 feature maps of size 3×3.
4.Pooling layer taking the max over 2*2 patches.
5.Dropout layer with a probability of 20%.
6.Flatten layer.
7.Fully connected layer with 128 neurons and rectifier activation.
8.Fully connected layer with 50 neurons and rectifier activation.
9.Output layer.
